# ImageFinder
How it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPxEUjogx3M
As image source uses Bing -> frequent use of same GET-request without proper browser/human behavior during debug provoked Google and Yandex ban.

Uses next npm packages:  
react-native-router-flux      //navigation  
cheerio-without-node-native   //react-native JQuery for html parsing  
react-native-easy-grid-view
